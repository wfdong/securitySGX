TODO list the expected SDK hooks here used by `libsgxstep` and how to port to a new libOS/SDK.

> :warning: **Note.** Proper integration of SGX-Step with different runtimes is
> still an outstanding issue (#28). Currently, only the Intel SDK is
> "officially" supported. An (untested) stub to start on integration with
> Gramine is, furthermore, provided "as is" in the `gramine` directory.
